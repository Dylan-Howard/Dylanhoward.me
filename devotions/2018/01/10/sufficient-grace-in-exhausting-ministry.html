<p class="quote">2 Corinthians 12:9</p>
<hr />

<p>Here is a story:</p>
<p>My responsibilities blinded me. I could not see what was going on in my life. I was striving to stay well, but, in my pride, I pressed on until I had nothing. I was spent. I was physically, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually empty. I was anxious about my grades. I did not have time to complete projects and applications. I was trying to make life decisions. I was trying to be faithful in ministry. I was exhausted. My soul like a pot of boiling oil. It flowed. It turned. It tossed. It bubbled and spat.</p>
<p>I was at a ministry event, and the exhaustion and turmoil in my soul plagued me. During a moment of isolation, I felt as if I could not handle it. It continued for the next week. The next Thursday, I had just finished all my finals and intended to spend time with a good friend. I got coffee and ended up staying with him for around four hours. We had no agenda, and I laid out all that was weighing on me. I mentioned, not only this turmoil and exhaustion in me, but how I was preparing for a week of intense ministry. I felt entirely inadequate for this task and I was incredibly anxious over this. I debated not going. I feared I would hinder the work that would take place.</p>
<p>Friday morning, I was still this way. As we walked through the airport, my team leader asked if anything was burdening my mind. I lied. I replied, "Nope, I'm just tired." How grievous had I become? In my pride, I was deflecting spiritual aid from a loving brother. The Lord tore me down even me.</p>
<p>Praise be to Him; God mightily worked through me. He advanced His kingdom through me. Thanks be to God!</p>
<p>Though I was empty, exhausted, and unable to do this task, the steady hum that the gears of my spirit sang was "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." The Lord sustained me through the weak. My soul was at rest. He lifted my spirit. I even had plenty of physical energy. My ability to serve was nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>Just think, Friday morning, I am exhausted and defeated by the vanity and emptiness apart from Christ. But then, Saturday afternoon (and throughout the week), I am filled with wonder. My whole self is animated with joy, and I serve His kingdom with gladness. How else could this be, other than God's merciful power? Who else can receive glory for this than God?</p>
<p>God calls us into existence (Genesis 1:26-27), calls us to life in Christ by His Spirit (Ezekiel 37:9-10, John 10:27; 11). By His will and power, we also continue to exist (Colossians 1:17). Every resource we have—from our time and breath, to our spiritual vitality and desires—is from above. This is why we depend on grace. This is why it must be sufficient for us–because we have nothing else to suffice.</p>
<p>So, what is Paul's response to recognizing His weakness? It is gladness! Paul is filled with joy. Why? Because God, in His infinite wisdom, has seen it fit to glorify Himself by using our dead souls to resurrect, redeem, and restore His creation. God does this—He wins our hearts for the worship that He already deserves—for His good pleasure, and we are glad beneficiaries of this.</p>
<p>Consider this old hymn:</p>
<p class="quote">Should nothing of our efforts stand</p>
<p class="quote">No legacy survive</p>
<p class="quote">Unless the Lord does raise the house</p>
<p class="quote">In vain its builders strive</p>
<p class="quote">All Glory Be to Christ – Robert Burns (1759-1796)</p>
<hr />

<p class="quote">GRACIOUS FATHER, may our hearts resound with this truth. Let it reverberate through all our essence. Motivate us to kill our pride. Calm us to rest in Christ's righteousness and Your Spirit's power in all our labors. Fill us with the joy of Your Sprit, and let us join in glad service to all, for Your glory among all. In Christ's name, Amen.</p>
