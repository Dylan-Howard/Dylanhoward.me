          <p class="quote">"15b...[The Scriptures] are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."</p>
<p class="quote">2 Timothy 3:15b-17</p>
<hr />

<p>There's so much to talk about here, and I may follow up on this in another letter, but for now, I was to focus on the last half of verse 15 and the fits half of 16. The cool thing here is that God describes all of Scripture as being ‘breathed'. Isn't that a weird way of saying it? If I missed a class, I wouldn't go up to my classmate the next day and ask, "Hey, did the teacher breath out any important information?" If I did, they'd probably move a few seats away from me.</p>
<p>But I see Paul being very deliberate with this word here. This same word is used: in Genesis 1, God breathed life to a lifeless Adam. In Ezekiel 37, God breathes life into a valley full of corpses and brings them to life. This same action of breathing life into dead people is the same action that Paul's describing here. Paul's pointing out that God is breathing life into His Word and that, in effect, His Word is powerful to effect life in those who read/hear it.</p>
<p>How cool is that? That by intaking the Word of God, we are intaking the life that He's breathed into His Word. This is why it's vital for us to take in God's Word—by memorizing it, by reading it, by studying it, by meditating on it, and by praying it—and to cling to it for life in all things. God has blessed us with this great gift; we have the fullness of God's life giving power at our finger tips, in our language. We should be full of thanksgiving to God for His Word and we should center our lives on this gift.</p>

<p class="quote">O' GOD OF LIFE,</p>
<p class="quote">I thank You for Your holy Word, their teachings, promises, directions, light. In them may we learn more of Christ, be enabled to retain His truth and have grace to follow it.</p>
<p class="quote">Help us to lift the gates of our souls so that He may come in and show us Himself when we search the Scriptures, for we cannot begin to fathom its depths, and have no ability to comprehend its heights.</p>
<p class="quote">By His aid may we be enabled to explore all its truths, love them with all our heart, embrace them with all our power, embed them into our life.</p>
<p class="quote">Bless to our souls all grains of truth garnered from Your Word; may they take deep root, be refreshed by heavenly dew, be ripened by heavenly rays, and be harvested to our joy and Your praise.</p>
<p class="quote">Help us to gain profit by what we read, as treasure beyond all treasure, a fountain which can replenish our dry hearts, with waters flowing through each of us as an everlasting river sustained by Your Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="quote">Enable us to learn from its pages faithful prayer that grasps the arm of Your almighty power, achieves wonders, obtains blessings, and draws down streams of mercy.</p>
<p class="quote">From it show us how our words have often been so unfaithful to You, harmful to our fellow humans, empty of grace, full of folly, and dishonoring to our calling. Then write Your own words upon our hearts and engrave them on our lips, so all glory would be to You in our reading of Your Word!</p>
