          <p>The scene is opened with the apostle John leading us into God's throne room--the cosmic control center. God sits on his throne surrounded by His colonels and generals: four creatures, twenty-four elders, and a powerful army of angels. The floor around the throne is like crystal and lightning flashes and rumbles.</p>
<p>All eyes are fixed on this scroll that has been sealed seven times. In this scroll are the final chapters of God's fallen creation and His plan for restoration. As the scroll is unrolled, the events take place in real time.</p>
<p>An angel cries loudly, "Who is worthy to open the scroll?" There is silence. Not one creature claims worthiness to open the scroll.</p>
<p class="quote">"...and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it."</p>
<p class="quote">Revelation 5:4</p>
<hr />

<p>John is overwhelmed with the emotion of this moment. No one in sight seems able to resolve this issue. No one is able to open this scroll and with it bring evil into judgement and restoration to the broken creation. As streams of tears flow down the apostle's face, and elder approaches him.</p>
<p class="quote">"And one of the elders said to me, 'Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.'" – Revelation 5:5</p>
<p>The centerpiece of this chapter--the centerpiece of all creation--is Christ. He was slain for poor sinners like us. We are beggars before Him, but we worship Him as the great Giver of life.</p>
<p>Friend, this is great news! This is cause for great joy and this is ought to be the primary focus of all we do. We don't live easy lives, but we do live joy-filled lives. Our joy isn't found in living a life without trial, but our joy is found in delighting in Him--that we have the blessing of seeing and savoring Him who saved us. This is our motivation (fixation on the Cross) towards day-in-day-out, seemingly obscure faithfulness to Him.</p>
<hr />

<p class="quote">ALMIGHTY SOVEREIGN,</p>
<p class="quote">We confess that we are slow to learn and weak to do. We stumble over Your truths, and forget them so easily. How often You've reminded us of Your absolute goodness, absolute sovereignty, and absolute knowledge, and how often we've forgotten these things, doubted them, and treaded over them.</p>
<p class="quote">O God, have mercy on us. We need Your aid, Your constant provision to Your church. You've promised to provide and care for us, just as one provides and cares for their body.</p>
<p class="quote">Thank You for Your these promises. The greatest of which is the hope of the Cross. Let us live with great confidence and great joy in light of this.</p>
<p class="quote">Praise be to You, the slain Lamb, the One worthy of opening the scroll.</p>
