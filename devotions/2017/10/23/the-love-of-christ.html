          <p class="quote">"For God is my witness, how deeply I miss all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. And I pray this: that your love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment, so that you can approve the things that are superior and can be pure and blameless in the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God."</p>
<p class="quote">Philippians 1:8-11</p>
<hr />

<p>I empathize with Paul’s heart and mind here. Paul loved the Philippian church members deeply and, as he sat imprisoned in Rome and wrote this letter, he remembered them and expressed his affection for them. His affection was not a merely casual acquaintance. In fact, his affection for them surpassed all the affection possible in a world sense, and encompassed his entire being: the deepest depths of both his body and his spirit. Paul’s love for these people was founded in their common bond in Christ (both his love for Christ, and Christ’s love for them), and strengthened by their experiences and encouragement together. This produced an intense longing in Paul for these people.</p>
<p>It was during my drive last night that I came to understand that I have this same affection for you and miss you. As Paul prayed for his beloved brothers and sisters, it is also my deep desire that you’d keep growing in your knowledge of God (not a simple intellectual knowledge, but an understanding of God in your heart, mind, and soul) and that this knowledge would end in greater purity and your increased enjoyment of God. It is my prayer that these letters would help achieve that end: that these would remind you of my commitment, as a brother and friend, to helping you follow Jesus, which is our greatest concern.</p>
<hr />

<p class="quote">LOVING FATHER,</p>
<p class="quote">Whatever is perfect and pure and good is ultimately from You. I am eternally grateful for them. I’m thankful for Your providence in bringing them into my life, allowing me to know them, and for your provision and care for them.</p>
<p class="quote">I come to You in humility, knowing I can’t provide for them. Yet, in my weakness, I stand firmly and powerfully on Your promise that “the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.” In this boldness that is rooted in You, I ask that You would grant them to love You deeply. Allow them to continue growing into You in every way of their life. Let them know You more and let that knowledge of You not result in arrogance or pride, but in love and humility.</p>
<p class="quote">Please appoint that this deep love for You would result in them walking in purity and blamelessness, and let them cling to the promise that “blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” O Lord, let them see your glory, your beauty, your immensity, and let them be captivated and moved by this. Let them live each second of their lives in perfect view of You.</p>
<p class="quote">Merciful Redeemer, when them inevitably fails you, as we all do so often, remind them of Your great grace and finishing work You’ve accomplished in Christ and that this righteousness is sealed to them by Your Holy Spirit. Let them find great joy in this truth. Praise be to You for this great redemption.</p>
<p class="quote">All glory be to Christ, along with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, forever. Amen.</p>
