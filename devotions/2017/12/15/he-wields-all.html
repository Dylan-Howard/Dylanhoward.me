          <p class="quote">1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 And all went to be registered, each to his own town. 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. 6 And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>
<p class="quote">Luke 2: 1-7</p>
<hr />

<p>Consider the circumstances in this story. Caesar Augustus declared a census. Mary was almost ready to give birth. Joseph (a descendent of David) betrothed Mary. God threaded all these together at the perfect time. He did this to fulfill His Word in Micah 5:2. Isn’t this peculiar?</p>
<p>This is a rich example of God’s sovereignty. Namely, that God pre-ordained these perfect circumstances. God put it in the heart of Caesar to conduct a census so that He would eventually redeem His people. We see that God wields mighty empires in His hands to glorify Himself. He controls the political powers of the world to bring immense joy to His people. Solomon spoke to this when he said,</p>
<p class="quote">The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he will.</p>
<p class="quote">Proverbs 21:1</p>
<p>I learned this past week that a few years ago, in a North African kingdom, an intense persecution broke out against the Church. Islam reigned in this country and they sought to exterminate everything else. The persecution was especially brutal for the native believers. They suffered well for the name of Christ. They proclaimed salvation in Christ alone throughout it all, but they suffered. This story is common in the world, and rightly inspires prayer for the persecuted Church. However, if we’re not careful, we can miss the beauty of God’s sovereign work.</p>
<p>Prior to this, most people in this country believed that it was impossible for Muslims to become Christians. Now, because of the mistreatment, slander, and so on, they are very aware that Muslims can, and have, become Christians. They are interested in these stories of conversion and are more open to hearing Gospel truths.</p>
<p>This story rings with the words of Joseph in Genesis 50:20,</p>
<p class="quote">As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.</p>
<p class="quote">Genesis 50:20</p>
<p>Indeed, we have an almighty God who exercises His authority over political powers and economic forces to sovereignly promote His glorious redemptive work. His ways are truly beyond our comprehension. He often employs suffering and hardship—that is, He sovereignly allows such events—to bring exceeding joy to His people and build His church. What the world—and its father, Satan—intend for destruction and pain, the Lord powerfully uses to give everlasting life and joy.</p>
<p>Isn’t this good news for us? That God is powerful over even the strongest of systems, and that He wields them in His hand to care even the smallest and most insignificant citizens of His kingdom. God orchestrated the entire Roman empire to move two nobodies 70 miles to a small dirty town outside of Jerusalem. Take heart, our King is mighty over all other kings. They will one day bow before Him, and we will have rest as we behold Christ’s glory. But, until then, let us hold to the faith with steadfast hope. Let us rest that all things are under Christ, our Lord.</p>
<hr />

<p class="quote">ALMIGHTY GOD, You alone are worthy of worship. All else are idols. In the fullness of Your love, You have become truly man to bear the shame of many and redeem them on the cross. By Your death, many live. Hallelujah!</p>
<p class="quote">FATHER, while this truth is great, so many have not heard, and so many are under persecution for this truth. They live under the oppression of Islam, in the darkness of a system that demands their fearful obedience to gain favor from a false god.</p>
<p class="quote">O GOD, would You save them? Would You show them the depth of their sinful darkness and the bright glory of Your holiness? Let them mourn over the great gap between these two. But, God, in the next breath, breathe life into them. Let them rejoice in the knowledge that You have provided a righteousness that is not our own, but Christ’s. Let them treasure Him. Let them grow in love and faith. Let them persevere with the steadfast hope of their reward—the reward of beholding You throughout eternity.</p>
<p class="quote">I ask these things for Your glory by the mighty name of Christ, Amen.</p>
