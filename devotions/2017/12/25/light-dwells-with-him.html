          <p class="quote">What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortals.</p>
<p class="quote">Daniel 2:11</p>
<hr />

<p>The opening chapters of Daniel overflow with the God’s supremacy over all. Daniel and his friends were compelled to not eat the unclean food (1:8), but God granted them favor and compassion (1:9), and unnatural health (1:15). Daniel and his friends were trained for the king’s courts, and the Lord gave them superior knowledge and understanding (1:17,19). Over and over again, God displayed His multifaceted excellence.</p>
<p>Again, in chapter two, God prepared an opportunity to display His supremacy further. The king has a dream. Now, he wants an interpretation, but he wants a true interpretation, so he keeps the dream secret and demands that his interpreters tell him his dream and the interpretation.</p>
<p>Now, this task is certainly outside of man’s reach, but perfectly within God’s. The king’s usual interpreters recognize this, but with error. They say, "how can we do this? Only gods can and they’re far away. There’s no way this can be done" (2:11).</p>
<p>This statement offers a challenge that fills out the display of God’s supremacy so far in Daniel. Yes, God is immeasurable in power and wisdom, but He is not remove from His people. He dwells with them. He is close by and intimately involved in their lives.</p>
<p>After this statement, the king began to execute these men (who conspired to lie to him about the dream). Eventually, Daniel and his friends plead for the Lord to show mercy, and He reveals the dream and its interpretation to them. In response Daniel praises God. Notice this phrase in Daniel’s praise,</p>
<p class="quote">He knows what is in the darkness</p>
<p class="quote">and light dwells with Him.</p>
<p class="quote">Daniel 2:22</p>
<p>God is supreme over all—light and dark, good and evil—yet, in His kindness, He’s came to dwell with darkness for a time, so that He may become darkness, and defeat it. He’s redeemed His people from darkness to light, from death to life.</p>
<p>The king’s dream, desire, and precautions. Daniel’s true interpretation and praise. All of these were orchestrated by God to bring glory to His name and good to His people. Take heart, God’s perfect and unwavering sovereignty and desire for His glory is a rock-solid foundation for our hope in salvation. This is the message of Christmas: we have a God who dwelled with us, so that His people may dwell with Him.</p>
<hr />

<p class="quote">GREAT GOD,</p>
<p class="quote">May Your name be honored throughout all generations,</p>
<p class="quote">You reign supreme over all. Nations and kings rise and fall at Your will.</p>
<p class="quote">None are wise, unless You, the Spring of All Wisdom and Knowledge, flows into them. None are powerful, unless You, the Great Builder, fortify and strengthen them.</p>
<p class="quote">In Your manifold perfections, You’ve exceeded all earthly understanding of Your glory.</p>
<p class="quote">In Your goodness, You’ve judged our sin, but in Your mercy, You’ve judged it on Christ.</p>
<p class="quote">In Your grace, You’ve given us life and peace, if only we turn from our sin and trust in You.</p>
<p class="quote">May we rest in the peace of Your absolute sovereignty, and tender intimacy. May Your word reign supreme in our lives, as we treasure Christ more fully. I ask this in His name, Amen.</p>
