          <p>Last summer some friends and I saw some state parks online that we wanted to visit. So, like typical college students without many responsibilities, we got up early one morning and loaded up in a car for a road trip. What we were particularly interested in were these two waterfalls. I could remember visiting different waterfalls around our area when I was younger, but I wanted to visit them and really appreciate the beauty of where we live.</p>

<p>When we got there, the waterfalls were cool, but it was nothing like I had expected. We could walk down the stream, up to the edge, and look over the falls.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, a friend showed me where she and her family had visited the same waterfalls. However, when they visited, these waterfalls were raging! They couldn’t stand anywhere near where we stood, or they would have been swept away and over the edge. I couldn’t believe it! I was in awe of how swift the water was flowing through there.</p>

<p>What is it about power that puts us in awe? For sure, it shows itself in different ways depending on whether we’re male or female, but we still look at great powerful things and we can’t help but stare in amazement. We can’t help but take it in. In some way, we even feel some level of satisfaction with this. It’s almost as if we’re made to wonder at powerful things.</p>

<p>I think, in a lot of ways, this is the way we ought to interact with God. I think this text that we’re about to study, shows us the massive power of God, and the only proper response is for us to stare in wonder at His power, and surrender ourselves in complete obedience. So, if you have your Bibles, look with me at Ephesians chapter 2.</p>

<p>In the book of Ephesians, Paul is writing this letter to the church members in the Ephesian Church. As Paul finishes this great introduction to his letter where he praises God for all that He’s done, Paul writes down a prayer that he’s praying for these Ephesian Christians. And, essentially, Paul’s praying that these Christians would keep on growing in Christ. Listen to the final thing Paul prays for them because this is the launching pad for the text that we’re looking at right after it:</p>

<p>“I pray that you may know…the immeasurable greatness of His power to us who believe, according to the working of His vast strength.” – Ephesians 1:18a,19 (Modified)</p>

<p>Paul’s praying that these Ephesians Christians would know even more the great power of God in their salvation, and that this would drive them into a greater relationship with God. Paul is ultimately writing this text we’re going to look at to point the Ephesians to God’s mighty power in their salvation, and not their own. To sum up the central theme of the passage, it’s The Immeasurable Greatness of God’s Power in Salvation. Maybe you want it shorter; you can just say God’s Power in Salvation.</p>

<p> “And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler who exercises authority over the lower heavens, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love that He had for us, made us alive with the Messiah even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace! Together with Christ Jesus He also raised us up and seated us in the heavens, so that in the coming ages He might display the immeasurable riches of His grace through His kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift— not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are His creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them.” – Ephesians 2:1-10</p>

<p>Now, there’s a lot going on there, but I want to point out just two main truths that this passage shows us: “Our Weakness in Our Salvation”, and “God’s Power in Our Salvation”.</p>

<p>Our Weakness in Our Salvation
So, before Paul shows the Ephesians the power of God in their salvation, he shows them how great they need God’s salvation.</p>

<p>Think about it this way. Have you all ever been in a really dark room inside and then run outside really quick? Wasn’t it incredibly bright outside? But as you spent some time out there, it started to wear off and you couldn’t really appreciate just how bright it is outside. In the same way, Paul is reminding these people of just how deep they were in darkness before He reminded them of just how great God’s glory is.</p>

<p>Paul fleshes the idea of their weakness out in four key ways: he shows them that they’re dead in their sins, he shows them that they’re in the sins of the world, he shows them that they’re in obedience to Satan, and he shows them that they’re ultimately under God’s wrath.</p>

<p>Man is dead in their sins
“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins” – Ephesians 2:1</p>

<p>Normally, when people talk about God’s salvation and our need for it, they talk about how we’ve sinned against God and how we need His forgiveness. This is entirely right, but it’s not the whole picture and it’s not the point of Paul’s statement here to the Ephesians. What he’s saying is that because of their sin, they’ve become dead to God. They’re not just sitting in timeout because they’ve done some wrong; they’re lying down in a morgue because they’ve separated themselves from God.</p>

<p>This is part of the reason we so greatly need God to save us. Think about how weak a dead person is. Can that person cry out to God? Can that person make their way back to Him? Can that person decide to live a better life and then carry it out? Of course not! They’re dead. They’re unable to move, they’re unable to see, they’re unable to feel. They’re entirely senseless to God.</p>

<p>Man is in the world’s sin
Not only is man dead in their sins, but man is in the world’s sin.</p>

<p>“in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world…” – Ephesians 2:2a</p>

<p>Paul’s talking about how they’re right in step with the world. That the entire world is in this state of death from sin.</p>

<p>And Paul’s not saying that they’ve done some bad things from time to time and that’s resulted in this death. When he says “the ways of this world”, he’s talking about a way of life. This was their lifestyle. This sin and rebellion to God wasn’t just occasional, but they lived in it every moment of their lives.</p>

<p>Now, Paul’s applying this to the world here. He’s pointing out that it’s ordinary to live a life of sin. It makes you fit in, in our world. We’re familiar with drawing some lines between the world’s way and what a Christ follower should do. Lines like, homosexuality, or abortion, or gender identity. And don’t get me wrong, these are great boundaries, but we so often neglect other boundaries and are content to walk hand-in-hand with the world in them. Boundaries like money, or time, or relationships, or education.</p>

<p>Understand, I say this with love and grace, but whether it’s lavishly spending our money on cool toys, wasting our time watching Netflix, only maintaining friendships with people that we enjoy being around, or constantly complaining about school and it’s pointlessness, these are all massively self-centered ways of thinking.</p>

<p>Brother and sisters, that way of thinking is entirely self-centered, entirely of this world and, as we’ll see in a second, entirely of Satan. We are called to think about all of these aspects of our lives in a manner that is centered on God and His glory among all people, and if we fail to do that we fail to follow Christ.</p>

<p>Man is in obedience to Satan
So, not only is man dead in their sins and in the world’s sin, but they’re in obedience to Satan. Paul goes on and says…</p>

<p> “…according to the ruler who exercises authority over the lower heavens, the spirit now working in the disobedient.” – Ephesians 2:2b</p>

<p>What Paul’s showing us is that man is walking in obedience to Satan. All of these things we just mentioned—money, time, relationships, and so much more—in all of them, a man-centered view is right in step with Satan. Obedience in these ways is obedience to Satan, and disobedience to God.</p>

<p>Man is under the wrath of God
Finally, not only is man dead in their sins, not only is man in the world’s sin, and in obedience to Satan, but man is under the wrath of God. Look at verse 3.</p>

<p> “We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also.” – Ephesians 2:3</p>

<p>Paul is pointing out that because of the vast disobedience of these Ephesian Christians, that they are rightly due God’s wrath.</p>

<p>Paul explains it this way in his letter to the Colossian church:</p>

<p>“…sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these, God’s wrath comes on the disobedient.” – Colossians 3:5b-6</p>

<p>Understand this, what verse 3 is showing us is that the deepest part of ourselves—the very foundation—is passionate about sin and condemned to God’s wrath.</p>

<p>Now, God’s wrath is so often ignored or looked over to move on to more palatable topics like God’s love or how He blesses the good, but I want to camp out here for a second. Understand this, our chief issue in life isn’t that God is perfectly good and we just aren’t good enough, it’s that God is perfectly good and we are entirely evil.</p>

<p>We like to soften the reality of this or leave this out when we share the Gospel, but the moment we do, we engage in one of the deadliest lies. Understanding God’s wrath on the wicked is absolutely key to our understanding of the Gospel.</p>

<p>So, what we see in these first three verses is that we have aligned ourselves with the sin of the world and with the evil one. We’ve placed our affections and our allegiances in the very things that opposed God. And we’ve so engaged with them that we’ve not just become numb to God, but we’re dead to Him—unable to feel Him: unable to sense His warmth, unable to see His glory, unable to know Him, unable to turn to Him. We’ve created a massive chasm between us and God. And this is the worst part of sin, that we are separated from Him, dead in our sins, due His wrath.</p>

<p>What is our hope? Praise God that that isn’t the end of it. We aren’t just weak and in desperate need of God. He has provided for us, in our need.</p>

<p>So let’s look at this next truth: God’s Power in Our Salvation.</p>

<p>God’s Power in Our Salvation
Look with me at verse 4.</p>

<p>“But God…”</p>

<p>Isn’t that great to hear? Can’t you imagine the Ephesian Christians all gathered around this one guy reading them this letter and as soon as he reads the words “But God,” they erupt in joy and praise.</p>

<p>“But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love that He had for us, made us alive with the Messiah even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace!” – Ephesians 2:4-5</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, this is great news! The good news of the Gospel is that God has saved us! He’s freed us from the death and the penalty of sin.</p>

<p>I love the way that Charles Spurgeon put it:</p>

<p>“I have a great need for Christ and I have a great Christ for my need.” – Charles Spurgeon</p>

<p>Now, you might be asking, “How is this even possible? How can God actually save us?”</p>

<p>God has saved us by sending His son Jesus Christ to take our sin and die in our place. 2 Corinthians 5:21 tells us that…</p>

<p>“He made the One who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” – 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>

<p>Even though Christ lived a perfect, sinless life, in obedience to God the Father, Jesus went to the cross, He took every sin of every one of His people, and in exchange He gave us His perfect righteousness. He died the death that we deserved to die, and He rose again to prove that He had defeated all of our sins.</p>

<p>Martin Luther put it this way,</p>

<p>“By a wonderful exchange, our sins are no longer ours but Christ’s, and the righteousness of Christ not Christ’s but ours. He has emptied himself of His righteousness that He might clothe us with it and fill us with it; and He has taken our evils upon himself that He might deliver us from them.” – Martin Luther [Modified]</p>

<p>And now, by His grace, we only need to repent and believe in Him for salvation.</p>

<p>So, I want to point out three quick sub-truths about God’s salvation. Now, we’ve already touched on the first one, but I want to make sure we’re clear on it: God has saved us by His grace through faith.</p>

<p>God saves us by His grace through faith
Look at the end of verse 5 again.</p>

<p>Now, jump ahead to verses 8 and 9.</p>

<p>“For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift— not from works, so that no one can boast.” – Ephesians 2:8-9</p>

<p>Paul is making it abundantly clear that our salvation is not from ourselves. So, if you missed the entire first truth of this passage—that we are weak and in desperate need of God’s salvation—here it is again. We can’t find any power or goodness in ourselves to save us, and we are desperately dependent on God in our salvation.</p>

<p>He’s done this by His grace. He’s given us what we don’t deserve, that is, salvation from the power of sin and the penalty of sin and, soon to be, the presence of sin.</p>

<p>God applies this salvation to us by faith. Think of it this way, just like a worker uses their tools to do a job, faith is the instrument that God uses to save us.</p>

<p>Now, understand this, faith is a gift from God. Look at the end of verse 8: “it is God’s gift”. Paul makes it explicitly clear to these Ephesians that this is not from us.</p>

<p>We can’t stir up faith in our heart. Faith is not a struggle or strain to get; we cannot muster up faith in ourselves, it must be breathed into us from the Spirit of God. Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones said it this way,</p>

<p> “With faith, there is no strain or tension; rather, it has the element of assurance and confidence in it. If there is strain or tension, trying to persuade yourself to keep from doubting, you can be quite sure that it is not faith, faith is not the law of mathematical probability, faith is not natural, faith is spiritual, the gift of God. You cannot command faith at will, faith is always something that is given by God.” – Martyn Lloyd-Jones [Modified]</p>

<p>Isn’t that a beautiful truth? Praise God for giving us great gifts like faith.</p>

<p>You know, I was talking with a guy last week, who’s in the fraternity that I help lead a bible study with. He was retelling me about how all last semester he wasn’t a believer and he was wrestling with doubt and faith. He thought he might be saved, but he didn’t really know. But, this summer he was visiting a church with his parents, and he said he couldn’t think of any other way to describe it, but there was a heavy burden on him as the preacher was sharing the Gospel. He said at that moment, it wasn’t a struggle anymore. He didn’t have to strain for faith in God’s salvation, he believed. Praise God that, at that moment, he was given faith as a gift. He was saved, not from himself, but from God!</p>

<p>This is why Paul is clear to point out that salvation through faith it’s something we can’t boast in. Look at verse 9.</p>

<p>“Not from works, so that no one can boast.” – Ephesians 2:9</p>

<p>No one can boast in their salvation because it’s entirely from God. We are entirely dependent on God at each and every step of our salvation. And rightly understood, the Gospel produces deep humility in us and deep thanksgiving to God.</p>

<p>God saves us for His glory
So, not only does God save us by His grace through faith, but God saves us for His glory. Look at verses 6 and 7.</p>

<p>“Together with Christ Jesus He also raised us up and seated us in the heavens, so that in the coming ages He might display the immeasurable riches of His grace through His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.” – Ephesians 2:6-7</p>

<p>This defeats any kind of self-centered Gospel. God used broken and weak, and, in all reality, dead people to show His great power. Just look at verse 7,</p>

<p>“so that in the coming ages He might display the immeasurable riches of His grace” – Ephesians 2:7</p>

<p>This ought to kill any thought in our minds that God saves us because He needs us for something.</p>

<p>We are not at the center of the universe, God is. We are not at the center of our salvation, God is. We are not at the center of God’s plan, God is. At the center and pinnacle of all things good is God, to whom belongs all the glory and praise forever for His wonderful mercy and grace that He’s shown us. And guess what, He WILL receive all the glory and praise.</p>

<p>God saves us for good works
So, not only does God save us by His grace through the gift of faith, and not only does save us for His glory, but God saves us for good works. Look at verse 10.</p>

<p>“For we are His creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them.” – Ephesians 2:10</p>

<p>Paul’s telling the Ephesian church that their lives are now Christ’s. Paul said it this way in his first letter to the Corinthian church.</p>

<p>“You are not your own, for you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God in your body.” – 1 Corinthians 6:19b-20</p>

<p>We are His creation; we are His. We were bought at a price for God’s glory. Therefore, our only response to God’s salvation is that we must walk in humble obedience to God.</p>

<p>What are these good works? There are many ways this applies to our lives, but here’s just two big encouragements in light of these truths.</p>

<p>Encouragements
Rest in this Gospel
The first encouragement is to rest in this Gospel.</p>

<p>By resting in the Gospel, I mean stop relying on Yourself. As people, we are weak and needy creatures. We can’t save ourselves.</p>

<p>If you’re not a believer, I urge you, believe in this Gospel. We are lost in our sins and we’re separated from God. We’re dead to Him and facing His wrath, but He’s taken the sins of man on Himself on the cross. Believe in Him and He’ll save you.</p>

<p>Turn from your sin. Pray to God. You don’t have to wait for me to get done, you can do it right now in your seat. Ask Him to save you! He’s promised He will!</p>

<p>If you are a believer, we rest in the Gospel in a similar way. We rest in the saving power of Jesus. We rest in the knowledge that we are saved by grace alone through faith alone. We rest in the Gospel by trusting God to use our weaknesses for His glory and that He’ll provide for us in our Spiritual needs through His Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Just today I was in an evangelistic Bible study with some international students and we were looking at the story of the woman with the bleeding who reached out to Jesus and He healed her. I love the end of that story where Jesus looks to her and says, “Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” Because of the faith that He gave her, she was healed and she has an immeasurable peace.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters in Christ, that same peace is ours. Our strength is not found in ourselves, it’s found in Christ and Him alone. He is the Author of our faith, and He is the Finisher of our faith. As Christ followers, we strive for perfect obedience, but if our salvation is dependent on our obedience, we’re still doomed. It isn’t as if the Christ died for most of our sins, and it’s now up to us, with the Holy Spirit to keep the law. Friends, we rest in the knowledge that Christ we are saved by faith alone, and that the Holy Spirit will hold us and will keep sanctifying us.</p>

<p>Spread this Gospel
The second encouragement is to spread this Gospel.</p>

<p>God has provided salvation for us through Jesus Christ, but God, in His sovereignty, has decided to use His Church, to share this good news to others so that they might be saved. Not only that, but God empowered us by His Spirit to do these things. 2 Corinthians 5:20 says,</p>

<p>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, certain that God is appealing through us. We plead on Christ’s behalf, ‘Be reconciled to God.’” – 2 Corinthians 5:20</p>

<p>As we rejoice in this good news, we have to remember that there are so many people around us who don’t believe in this good news. And even more than that, there are billions of people around the world who haven’t even heard about this good news. I check this week and there’s an estimated 4.3 billion people who have little to no access to the Gospel. Brothers and sisters, we’re obligated to share this Gospel with them. Their eternity rests on it.</p>

<p>Now, you might ask, “Do you really think that they’re going to go to hell if they don’t even get to hear the gospel?” And I would ask you the question, “Do you really think that we can go to heaven if we don’t tell them the Gospel?”</p>

<p>Is it even possible that we can believe that we have the greatest news in the world, their only hope for salvation, and we can be content with not telling them. We can’t hold those two thoughts at the same time. We either believe the Gospel—that we are in great need of Christ and have a great Christ for our need—or we don’t believe the Gospel and we aimlessly hope that these people will be ok, despite being dead in sin and facing God’s wrath.</p>

<p>And as we think about sharing the gospel, we must remember that salvation is from God, and not from us. God has promised to operate through us to save His church. By His Spirit, and by Him alone, are we able to truly share the gospel.</p>

<p>Let’s pray…</p>

<p>Almighty Father,</p>

<p>You are great and mighty, but we are not.</p>

<p>We confess that we are sinners. In so many ways we’ve offended Your holiness and in all of our ways we’ve fallen short of Your glory. We’ve failed to rest in the assurance that You’ve taken all of our sins. We’ve failed to obey you in proclaiming this Gospel to those who need it. We know that we don’t deserve it, but please have mercy on us.</p>

<p>We thank You for the good news of the Gospel. That we were dead in our sins, but You have shown us mercy, love, and grace. You have saved us by taking our sins on Yourself on the cross and You have given us Your righteousness. You proved this to us by rising from the grave. We are eternally grateful for this.</p>

<p>Thank you for your Spirit who lives in us and makes us more like you. We ask that by His power, we would be able to rest in the knowledge of the Gospel. That those who don’t know You in this room would ask You to save them and that us who do believe would be assured of Your work in our lives and not strain for holiness but achieve it by abiding in You.</p>

<p>Please let us be burdened with the darkness in the world, passionate for the nations, and zealous for Your kingdom. Remind us that we are filled by You and that as we proclaim Your Gospel to others that You are making an appeal through us. Let us be bold and confident in light of that.</p>

<p>We ask all of these things for Christ’s glory among all people.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
