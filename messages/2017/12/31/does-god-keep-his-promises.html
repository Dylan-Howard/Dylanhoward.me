          <p>Prayer
GREAT FATHER,
Thank You for Your Word. It’s Your very breath, so we hold it precious to us.
With it, You mend our broken hearts, restore our dirtied souls, and rest our weary selves. Let us learn from it now, as You work to teach through me, and to apply it us. Help this weak man, teach Your mighty Word, Amen.
Sermon
If you’ve been with us the past few weeks you’ll know that we’re in a series looking at the different characters surrounding the birth of Christ. We’ve looked at Mary, the Shepherds, and Herod, and now we find ourselves looking at Simeon in Luke chapter 2.
As I was reflecting on this past year, in some ways, it felt like it passed quickly. But as I thought more, I realized just how much had happened in this year. Our new president was inaugurated, all of the unrest that came with that change, and even the guilty pleas of illegal activities surrounding his campaign.
The great tension between the United States and North Korea, and the intensifying contest of missile testing and political rhetoric.
The massacres in Las Vegas and Texas leaving so many families and communities devastated, while others began to question their own security from more events like this. Terrorist attacks all across Europe. Hurricanes absolutely obliterating cities and entire islands.
So much in our world is changing and shifting. The non-Christian looks at all of these things and asks: how can anything be stable? Is there anywhere I can rest on? Is there anything I can really rely on?
The Christian looks at all of these events and has to answer a similar question: How are we supposed to rest in God in this? Does God really keep His promises?
So as we look at Simeon in Luke chapter 2, let us keep these questions in mind: Does God keep His promises? And if God does keep His promises, can we rest securely on those promises?
So, I invite you to look with me to Luke chapter 2, verses 25 through 35.
Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
“Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.”
And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”
So, with the question in mind, “does God keep his promises,” I want us to notice two main ideas. The first is that God kept his promise and the second is how God intended to fulfill His promise.
God Kept His Promise
So, to the first point, notice that God kept his promise.
Verse 25 opens with a description of a man named Simeon. There’s not a whole lot of information on Him. He appears briefly. He shows up here in verse 25. And after verse 35, Simeon isn’t talked about anymore. Inside of these short ten verses, all the biographical data we’re given is that he just happened to be in Jerusalem. As far as his character, we know that he was a righteous and devout man. Righteous in his dealings with people, and devout in his dealings with God. However, there’s one unique fact about Simeon that helps us with our question of whether or not God keeps His promises. Look at verse 26.
26 And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
So God told Simeon that, before he dies, he would see the Messiah. But what did Simeon do with that promise? Verse 25 tells us that he waited. He looked forward to it.
One on the primary lessons that the Advent season teaches is the necessity of waiting. We don’t know how long Simeon had been waiting. It could have been days, weeks, months, years, even his entire life, but God’s people had been waiting on this promise for centuries.
They had been waiting from almost the beginning of time for a Savior that God had promised. Since the fall of Adam and Eve in the garden–the first sin of man–God had promised a Savior that would descend from Eve and redeem them. God’s people anticipated and longed for God’s promise to be fulfilled. Eve’s reactions to both Cain’s and Seth’s birth in Genesis 4 showed she was looking for the seed to bruise the serpents head that God promised in Genesis 3. She knew the Savior would be a descendent of hers, so she looked at each of them with great anticipation, but the Lord required her to wait.
Then, in Genesis 5, when Noah’s father reacted to His birth, he showed that he was looking forward to the same promise. Don’t turn there, but listen to Genesis,
29 “Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed, this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.”
Noah’s father was looking forward to the fulfillment of God’s promise, and he hoped his son would be able to restore the land that was cursed since the sin of man in the garden, but he had to wait.
We can look and see that God promised His comfort through His prophets. Through Isaiah, He said,
Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. [Isaiah 40:1]
Then, through Jeremiah, He said,
Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. [Jeremiah 32:37-38]
During Jesus’s ministry, even He made the comment,
“Many prophets and righteous people longed to see the things you see yet didn’t see them; to hear the things that you hear yet didn’t hear them.” [Matthew 13:17]
God made His promise to His people, but they had to wait. Throughout the Bible, God’s people longed to see this promise fulfilled, and slowly but surely, God revealed the fulfillment of His promise.
Simeon’s short story in the Scriptures is right in the transition between waiting, and seeing. Up until this point many people had been longing to see the Messiah, but Simeon, by God’s grace, was promised that he would eventually see him before death.
Just to make a quick comment about this, isn’t it remarkable how long God’s people were made to wait? At the same time, isn’t it fascinating how short of a time we wait before we become disinterested with a promise? Let me just quickly encourage you. As you’ll see, many people in Scripture waited. God’s intentions in waiting are for our holiness. Lean into waiting and lean into the pursuit of holiness.
Simeon Was Led To The Promise
But, like I said, Simeon was promised by God that he would see the Messiah. So let’s see if God stayed true to His word. Look at verses 27.
And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God… [Luke 2:27-28]
Peculiar, isn’t it? It wasn’t as if Simeon had heard of this baby Jesus and came to meet Him. It wasn’t as if the shepherds’ news from the month before had caused Simeon to be interested in this particular baby. But the Scripture says, “Simeon came in the Spirit into the temple”.
At the same time, Joseph and Mary were just carrying out their lives. They followed the custom of the law to have Jesus circumcised on the 8th day after his birth, and they were in the process of going to both dedicate their firstborn son (according to the law) and offer sacrifices to purify Mary (according to the law).
And what was the result of this divine appointment? God fulfilled His promise to Simeon, and revealed that He had kept His promise to His people.
Look at verse 28 again.
…he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” [Luke 2:28-32]
God promised that Simeon would see the Messiah, and God kept His promise. Simeon longed to see the Christ, and Simeon saw Him.
Simeon Saw The Christ
It reminds me of a kid around Christmas time. They know that Christmas means presents. One day, they see their parent put up a Christmas tree and they know that the tree is a sign–a promise–that Christmas is soon. But, there are no presents are under it. The kid goes to bed, wakes up, checks the tree; no presents. Brushes their teeth, checks the tree; no presents. Goes to school, comes home, checks the tree; no presents. They go on for weeks. Eventually, one morning, Christmas morning, they wake up, peak around the corner to check the tree one more time, and as they lay eyes on their gift, they’re filled with excitement and joy.
Friends, in a much, much greater sense, this is Simeon. Notice this, many people were more than likely around. In fact, Jesus probably wasn’t even the only baby that was there to be dedicated that day. But out of all of these people, Simeon, filled with the Spirit, saw the Christ, the promise of God, and was filled with peace.
Simeon Received Peace
Now, pay attention this, Simeon saw the incarnate God, and had peace. He saw the Son of God, and had the peace of God. How can this be? Lots of people saw this baby, but none of them are described as having peace. Simeon, by the power of the Spirit, was able to see Christ with spiritual eyes, and recognize Him as the Messiah.
Matthew Henry meditated on it this way, “the eye is not satisfied with seeing, till it [has] see Christ, and then it is [satisfied].”
Ecclesiastes tells us,
the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. [Ecclesiastes 1:8]
But, here we see Simeon, his eyes filled with the Christ, and finally satisfied with seeing.
Hear the command in Psalm 34:8,
“Taste and See the Lord is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.”
We aren’t commanded to just acknowledge with our minds that the Lord is good. We are commanded, look! See! Savor! The Lord is good. He is precious and delightful, full of pleasures forevermore.
Friends, if you don’t see Christ this way, I urge you, look! Pray that God would show you. Gaze upon Him, in all of His glory, in all of His majesty and perfection. Treasure Him. Delight in Him. Turn away from whatever pleasures you’re holding onto and embrace the eternal pleasures of God, just as Simeon embrace this baby Jesus.
Look at verse 28. Simeon said, “now, I can go in peace” implying that before, he didn’t have peace. Let me ask this: why might Simeon not have peace? Remember verse 25. Simeon was a righteous and devout man. Why might a righteous and devout man not have peace?
Paul answers this in Romans chapter 3 when he says,
What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. [Romans 3:9-11]
So we see, Simeon may have been righteous in man’s eyes, but failed to meet God’s perfect righteousness. This is why Simeon looked forward to God’s promise of a Savior.
You see, God didn’t only fulfill His promise to Simeon–that Simeon would see the Christ–God also fulfilled His promise of salvation to His people. He did this by sending His Son the die in our place. Christ made peace through the blood of His cross. You don’t have to turn to it, but hear Romans 5:1,
Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. [Romans 5:1]
Friends, the only way we for us to stand before a holy God, is to be holy. But for us to be holy, something has to happen with our sin. If God is just, sin must be punished.
This is the beauty of the gospel. God has come, lived a perfect life that we could not live, took the penalty for our sin on the cross, and rose to prove that all of our sins were paid for, and we may freely come to Him in faith.
If you’re not a believer in Christ, you may have grown up in church your entire life, but let me urge you, unless you turn from your sin and trying to justify yourself, you face eternal wrath.
Simeon saw the promise of God fulfilled. He saw the Messiah and treasured Him. One old hymn says it well,
I hear the words of love – I gaze upon the blood – I see the mighty sacrifice – and I have peace with God
Friend, the only means of true peace, is the peace of God through Jesus Christ. God has kept His promise and offered salvation to us.
This Salvation is Offered to All
It doesn’t end there. Look with me at verse 32. Understand, this salvation isn’t offered to just a certain group of people.
…a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” [Luke 2:32]
Friends, this salvation is offered to each and every person. Every social class, every nation, every ethnicity, every language. Not one person is left out from this offer of peace. Not one.
That’s why it’s so heart-breaking that out of the 7 billion people in the world, 2 billion of them have little to no access to the gospel. It’s a reality for these people that they will born, live, die, and never hear the gospel. Most of them will never even meet a Christian who can teach them the gospel.
That’s why it’s so important for us to take international mission so seriously. God has offered salvation to all people and commanded us to teach the gospel to all. That’s why we give freely to Lottie Moon to support the International Missions Board. That’s why we give to the Southern Baptist Convention to help support Seminaries that help to train missionaries and pastors who will labor to advance God’s kingdom. That’s why we pray, fervently, that God would raise up workers to go and teach the gospel to the nations. We don’t just put the names of missionaries at the bottom of our bulletins for looks. They are there to remind us to constantly intercede on their behalf. Not just for safety, we pray that they would be met with a field prepared for harvest by God, and that God would establish and build healthy local churches to carry on His mission.
But we shouldn’t neglect our neighbors either. If the gospel is for all people, they’re included. Maybe that’s something the Lord’s convicted you about. If that’s so, let me encourage you, there are brothers and sisters here who are members of Salem and would be glad to encourage you and help you in that discipline.
Maybe you could walk across the street, or down the road, and invite a neighbor to dinner. Build a relationship with them. Learn about them. Ask them about their faith. Begin to teach the gospel through seeds of truth. And, hopefully, as the Lord wills, they will turn and trust in Christ.
So, we’ve seen that God kept His promise to Simeon. Although, even more importantly, He has kept His promise of salvation, and offered it to all people. But what does it look like for God to keep that promise?
How God Intends to Keep His Promise
I want us to notice how God intends to keep His promise through Jesus. Look at verse 34 and 35.
34 And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed
35 (and a sword will pierce through your own soul), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”
We see here something of the cost that God has paid to fulfill His promise. We see the great torture that Christ has to endure to save His people. Two main points are mentioned in these verses: the certainty of Christ’s sacrifice and the ends (intent, results) of Christ’s sacrifice.
To address the first point, we see that God has appointed His Son to be the sacrifice. What does this mean that this child is appointed for something? Turn with me, to Acts chapter 4.
In this, the apostles Peter and John had just been arrested and interrogated for healing a man on the sabbath in the name of Jesus. When they are released, they are threatened not to speak in Christ’s name anymore.
So, when they get back to the other followers, they join together and pray, but notice what they pray in verse 27. They’re praising God and say,
…for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. [Acts 4:27]
We see here, very clearly, that God had planned the condemnation of His son. He planned to use the evil of Herod and Pontius Pilate, and everyone else, to condemn the blameless Messiah.
Friends, God’s sovereignty is not a problem for us to solve, it’s a truth that we are given to rest in. As we see here, it’s the foundation of the salvation that God has provided. It’s essential to Him keeping His promise. It wasn’t that some rulers were out of control and killed the living God. God wielded their hatred to offer His Son as a sacrifice. Proverbs tell us,
The king’s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he will. [Proverbs 21:1]
God, in His sovereignty, planned to use the evil hearts of the rulers so that Christ would be delivered once, for all the saints. (Hebrews 10:10)
This gives us a powerful confidence in facing a changing world. Knowing that we rest in God who exercises absolute control over it, gives us a supreme hope. We don’t have to worry about the outcome of different political decisions, or the up-and-down trends of the stock market, or even potential threats of natural disaster. We rest in the confidence that we serve a God who is in total control and directs all things according His will, for our ultimate good.
Furthermore, God’s sovereignty gives us boldness in teaching the gospel. Look at verse 29 in Acts 4.
And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness… [Acts 4:29]
These followers had just been arrested, beaten, and threatened. They were surely, rightfully, terrified. But, they prayed fervently that God would embolden them as they remembered His absolute control over even the most cruel moment in history.
Maybe you struggle with the nervousness that come with sharing the gospel with a co-worker, or a family member. Let this truth encourage you. Let your rest be in God’s total control, and gladly share the gospel with all.
The Purpose of Christ’s Condemnation
So lastly, back in Luke 2, not only has God appointed His Son to be condemned, but, He has done so for a distinct purpose. Look at verse 34 and 35 again.
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.” [Luke 2:34-35]
Christ has come for two distinct purposes. Christ came for the condemnation of many, and the salvation of others. He is both the aroma of life to some, and the aroma of life to other. He is foolishness to some, but wisdom to others. He is weakness to world, yet power to His saints. A stumbling block to many, but a way of salvation to others. He is a sign to be spoken against by some, but admired by others.
So what was the intention of Christ’s sacrifice? Verse 35 tells us it was to reveal the thoughts of many hearts. To whom are these intentions revealed? Our hearts are open and exposed to God who made all things, knows all things, and judges all things according to His perfect righteousness.
Maybe you’re here at church, today, to try to do your best and hope to earn your way to God’s favor. Don’t you see, we can’t retract back and hope that God can’t really see our hearts. We can’t hope that He sees the good things we do and forgets the deep darkness of our hearts. Each of us knows ourselves and we know the evil in our hearts. We may try to forget it, but we can’t go a day without it showing itself.
This is why me must rest in the gospel. This is why we turn from trying to justify ourselves, and turn to Christ. This is why we rejoice in the knowledge that even though the world shifts and changes, we have a God who keeps His promises. Namely, that we have a God who promised salvation to His people, and endured the cross to save us, if only we’d turn from our sin and trust in Him.
Let’s pray.
Prayer
LORD,
We thank you again, for Your word, and we thank you that You keep Your promises. You are perfectly faithful to keep them, and perfectly powerful to accomplish them.
By this truth and Your Spirit, let us be bold in the face of uncertainty, waiting patiently in trial, teaching the gospel to all, so that You may be magnified.
We ask this in Christ’s precious name, Amen.</p>
