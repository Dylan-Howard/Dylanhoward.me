          <p class="quote">"We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God: those who are called according to His purpose."</p>
<p class="quote">Romans 8:28</p>
<hr />

<p>This grieves my spirit. This is such a precious truth—that God works out every single thing for the good of His people. This is so dear to any believer in Christ. The hope of them in the confusion of life. Along with this truth, one more resonates a harmonic note with this: that God controls each and every thing in agreement with His will.</p>
<p>This verse/truth is so used and abused in our Bible-belt culture. So much so that it’s even led to it being the butt of numerous jokes and snarky remarks.</p>
<p class="quote">"...according to the purpose of the One who works out everything in agreement with the decision of His will..." – Ephesians 1:11b</p>
<p>Over the past week, I’ve been reminded of this truth, and, by God’s grace, forced to trust in this truth. The Lord has been faithful to remind me of the great treasure this is.</p>
<p>I’ve been burned out on school. I had so many things pile up and in this I felt so overwhelmed with the number of things that I needed to do and the things that I could’ve feasibly do well. On top of this, I read through Johnathan Edward’s resolutions (a list of resolutions he read each day to himself), and came across this:</p>
<p class="quote">"Resolved, never to do anything, which I should be afraid to do, if it were the last hour of my life." – Jonathan Edwards</p>
<p>In my mind and my spirit, I began to resent going to school and the classes I had because of their distraction from ministry and because I so easily could be doing other things that I love, like meeting with international students to talk about Jesus or train up some Lambda Chi guys in following Christ. I thought, "Why would I spend my last hour in school? Why would I waste my time like that? If it were my last hour to live, I’d never spend it in school; I’d spend it sharing the gospel among any group of people who’ve never heard."</p>
<p>What I thought was a wise and zealous ambition, after considering these truths, turned out to be me relying on my own intelligence, planning, and power in building God’s kingdom. This is near sighted and self-centered, and prideful. Thinking my decisions can cause more kingdom glory than God’s decisions is plain and simply a darkened and depraved understanding. This is thinking that I know better than God.</p>
<p>We must trust the promise of Romans 8:28. We must trust God with our time and following His will for His purposes. He has promised that each of these things will be for His ultimate glory and our ultimate good. He will build His church for His glory. (Matt. 16:18)</p>
<p>Should I be ok with spending my last hour trusting in God’s purposes? Absolutely.</p>
<p>My inability to understand His methods does not change the promise of the all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good God of the Universe, it simply means that I’m forced to lean into Him and trust Him in this.</p>
<p>How great is it that God uses such unable people to accomplish His purposes? This is cause for great joy and hope.</p>

<p class="quote">SOVREIGN GOD,</p>
<p class="quote">You are great and mighty; we are not. You are holy and perfect; we are not. You are infinitely knowledgeable and intelligent; we are not.</p>
<p class="quote">We confess that we are in this weak and needy state, but we praise You that you have seen it fit to save us for Your glory.</p>
<p class="quote">O Lord, we are so unable to understand your ways. You inspired Paul to write this praise:</p>
<p class="quote">"Oh, the depth of the riches</p>
<p class="quote">both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!</p>
<p class="quote">How unsearchable His judgments and untraceable His ways!"</p>
<p class="quote">We join Paul in exclaiming this praise. Despite our inability to understand your methods, let us trust you in these. Let us trust You with our time, our money, our relationships, and every other facet of our lives. Let us commit these to You, knowing that You’re sovereign over all things and that You work out all things for our good.</p>
<p class="quote">Let this produce a great peace in our lives, and a supreme trust in You.</p>
<p class="quote">Lord, may it be so, not for our sake, but for Christ’s.</p>
<p class="quote">To Him be the glory among all people. Amen.</p>
