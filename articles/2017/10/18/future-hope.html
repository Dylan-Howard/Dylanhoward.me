          <p class="quote">"29 For those He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers. 30 And those He predestined, He also called; and those He called, He also justified; and those He justified, He also glorified." Romans 8:29-30</p>
<hr />

<p>There's many heavy truths in this passage, but I just want to tease out one: the great joy for us in God's glorification of His people.</p>
<p>This passage promises that those God knew before the beginning of time will be conformed to Christ. We could stop there. Paul could have wrapped up his letter. But he didn't. He goes on and lays out the path for them: those who are predestined will be called, those called have been justified, and those justified will be glorified. Notice, these are not maybe's or might's, could's or should's, these are certainties. Those saved by Christ are kept by His Spirit. This should produce a great joy in us.</p>
<p>I was studying for Sunday school last week, and was thinking through the Lord's Supper. I was reminded of the expectation component of it. That, by taking the Lord's Supper, we look forward to Christ's return. I realized how deep a longing this is in my own life; how deeply I long for Christ's return! His return users in numerous things. Among these are: the end of chaotic weather, the end of evil acts of terror, the end of my own selfish desires which conflict with the lordship of Christ.</p>
<p>The last one consumed much of my time. How sweet it is to long for His kingdom's purity (which is assured to His people) when we are so foul in sin. With the hope promised in this passage, we long for His completed work of purification. With this hope, we long to be glorified and doing all things under his direct lordship—for both His glory, and our good. How incredible is it, not that we are simply saved, but kept in salvation.</p>

<p class="quote">LORD JESUS,</p>
<p class="quote">We sin — Grant that we may never cease grieving because of it, never be content with ourselves, never think we can reach a point of perfection. Kill our envy, command our tongue, trample down our self.</p>
<p class="quote">Give us grace to be holy, kind, gentle, pure, peaceable, to live for You and not for self, to copy Your words, acts, spirit, to be transformed into Your likeness, to be consecrated wholly to You, to live entirely to Your glory.</p>
<p class="quote">Deliver us from attachment to things unclean, from wrong associations, from the predominance of evil passions, from the sugar of sin as well as its pain, that with self-loathing, deep contrition, earnest heart searching we may come to You, cast ourselves on You, trust in You, cry to You, be delivered by You.</p>
<p class="quote">O' God, the Eternal All, help us to know that all things are shadows, but You are substance, all things are quicksand, but You are a mountain, all things are shifting, but You are an anchor, all things are ignorance, but You are wisdom.</p>
<p class="quote">Let us continually look forward to Your return as we pursue our earthly mission— full of hope and joy.</p>
<p class="quote">To Christ be the glory, along with the Father and the Spirit, among the Church, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
