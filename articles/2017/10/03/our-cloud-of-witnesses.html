          <p class="quote">"Therefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us…keeping our eyes on Jesus..."</p>
<p class="quote">Hebrews 12:1a,2a</p>
<hr />

<p>On October 31, 1517, a man, convinced of the truth of the Scriptures, nailed a list of theses to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany. Change was on the horizon; a mound of hay had been laid down and this man, Martin Luther, had struck the match and lit the fire. Because of this event, October 31, 2017 is marked as the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>Now, you may be like, "Great… Dylan's going to write about some boring history lesson...", but hear me out. Actually, hear the words of this verse.</p>
<p class="quote">"Therefore, since we have such a large could of witnesses surrounding us..." – Hebrews 12:1a</p>
<p>Paul addressed these Christians in light of the numerous saints that he mentioned in Hebrews 11: Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and many, many others. Among these saint who "were approved through their faith" (Hebrews 11:39), now stands our bold brother in Christ, Martin Luther. Although, not only him, but was Luther surrounded by many other reformers—heroes of the faith all over Europe such as Peter Valdo, John Calvin, Zwingli, and such.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you know each of these brothers and sisters or not, our Lord worked through their lives, and we can rejoice in freely studying and teaching the truths of the Scripture, and not the ‘truths' of the Pope. Among these truths that Luther held dear was the truth that we are in desperate need of Jesus.</p>
<p class="quote">"…keeping our eyes on Jesus..." – Hebrews 12:2b</p>
<p>The central point of the Reformation and the central point of Luther's convictions was Christ. In Luther's final moments, he was asked by a friend, "Do you want to die standing firm on Christ and the doctrine you have taught?" He answered emphatically, "Yes!" Luther's said: "We are beggars. This is true."</p>
<p>Luther understood the reality that that we truly are beggars of Christ. He understood that because God demands a righteousness we cannot produce, we are dependent on Him for this righteousness. In his words, we need an "alien righteousness". We need a righteousness produced and provided for us by another. Praise God that He has produces and provided this righteousness in Christ! We are now richly-blessed beggars in Christ. In Him, we've been given the Supreme Treasure of the Universe—God, Himself.</p>
<p>So, as we approach Reformation Day, and as we live past it, let us remember the saints who've lived before us, who were obedient slaves to Christ and who joyfully laid their lives down—both by devoting their time and by being martyred for preaching the truth. And, as we remember these brothers and sisters, let their fixation on Christ encourage us in the same way, and to lay our lives down for His sake.</p>

<p class="quote">ETERNAL FATHER,</p>
<p class="quote">You are unchanging. You see all and know all. You are powerful and Your Word declares that You have orchestrated the movement of all people and nations for Your purposes.</p>
<p class="quote">Among these movements is the Reformation and the heroes of our faith that have walked before us. You produced faith in these men that led to devotion to Your eternal cause. Let us walk in remembrance of these men, meditating on their boldness in You, contemplating their joy in affliction, reflecting on how different our lives would be if we followed You the same way.</p>
<p class="quote">O Lord, may it be so! We beg You for this obedience, yet we trust that this is produced in time, not all at once. Let us hold our time, our gifts, our talents and skills, even our very lives with loose grips. Let us steward these well for the cause of Christ.</p>
<p class="quote">As we walk in humble obedience, let us remember our status before You as beggars. Let us always recognize our need for Your righteousness and let us always praise You for Your gift of this righteousness.</p>
<p class="quote">To Christ be the glory among all people. Amen.</p>
